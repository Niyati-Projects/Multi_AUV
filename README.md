# Multi_AUV
This project simulates multi-robot behavior in an underwater-like environment with limited sensor input. A blimp-based AUV mimics underwater movement, providing 2D position data. One robot follows the AUV path, while others follow it when within LiDAR range. Hardware implementation of the AUV is complete; future work is ongoing.
